# DarkCroc Android Theme

A dark theme targeting Android 9.0 or higher, freely adapting the default material dark colors.

For information on supported platforms, available variants and how to report bugs, see [here](https://github.com/SpiritCroc/DarkCroc-Android-theme/blob/9.0-substratum/about.md).

### The new Default Dark

Consider this as the successor of my Default Dark theme series.

With the release of Android 9.0, I wanted to do a fresh start for following reasons:
- It became increasingly difficult to keep support for old platforms (Default Dark was initially created for Android 5 / Lollipop),
    as Substratum doesn't allow a smart overlay selection based on Android version, so I had to provide variants for user selection (ugh, user interaction required!) per app (ugh, more user interaction required!)
- Without the ambition to create a "default" dark theme, I'm more free in theming decisions
- I no longer feel the need to recreate the default Android look in dark (read: I don't really like the Android Pie look)
- Many custom ROMs now have dark themes already included, so there's not that much of a need for a "default" dark theme (except maybe stock ROM users, which I was never actually targetting with my themes)
