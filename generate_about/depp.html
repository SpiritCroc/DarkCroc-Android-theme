<h1 class="warn">Substratum not found!</h1>

<p>
    This theme was created for the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=projekt.substratum">Substratum</a> theming solution.<br/>
    This means that it will not provide any functionality on its own, but work in an add-on style with the above mentioned app, developed by a different team of developers.<br/>
    It seems like you have not installed the Substratum app on your device.<br/>
    If you still want to use this theme, please try to get the Substratum app to work on your device first.
</p><p>
    Unfortunately, Substratum will not work on all devices. Usually it requires a rooted device or a custom ROM with inbuilt Substratum support.<br/>
</p><p>
    Please also keep in mind that for an optimal experience, a custom ROM with the required Substratum support is recommended.
    This theme *might* also work on stock ROMs if they are close enough to the original Android code and Substratum works on them, but this is not officially supported.
